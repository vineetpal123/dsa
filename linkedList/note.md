## Linked List ##
What ? : type of linear datastructure , having collection of nodes 

nodes : had data value and address 

why ?

Reverse Linked List (Imp)
Two Approach : one with iteration and second recursive
In iteration save pointer of next element and map current pointer to previous
In Recursive approach , change pointer of current element and mapped to previous one.

# Merge two sorted linked list (imp)
# reverse linked list by kth group  
# find middle element of linked list (use slow and fast pointer)
# detect cycle in linked list
# remove cycle in linked list

# palindrom linked list 
Ex : 121, nitin
Approach : Space O(n) & Time (n)
1) traverse linked list and create array, after that traverse array and used two pointer on starting and end, then compare each value, 
    here space complexity is O(n) and Time is O(n)
2) find middle of linked list 
    reverse second half of linked list 
    compare first half and second half of linked list

## Add two number 
linked list 1 = 3 -> 4 -> null 
linker list 2 = 2 -> 3 ->0 ->  null 
ans =  2 -> 6 -> 4 -> null 
# Approach : 
    reverse both linked list 
    and after that traverse linked list and sum element of both linked list
# clone linked list (imp)    
# merge sort in linked list
# flatten linked list 

why merge sort in array list while quick sort in link list

# why quick sort is preffered over merge sort for sorting arrays
# does quick sort is a stable techniqe
# does quick sort is stable algorithm
# why quicksort prefer for linked list while merge sort is for arrays (imp)
